    <h1>Handler's Note</h1>
    
    

    <p>She was constantly talking about a place to "frolick about". I apoligize for the unprofessional exchange however she won't communicate other wise unless you "match her energy".</p>

    <em>Cherripa: </em>It's stuffy in here. <br>
    <strong>████: </strong> How do you know that? <br>
    <em>Cherripa: </em>I don't know, maybe because it's 80 degrees in an 8 x 8 room during autumn and we're in █████████!!? <br>
      <em>Cherripa: </em>It's cramped in here and there isn't enough room <i>for ACTIVITIES! I need a new place, a complex vessel of some sort, where my soul is free to frolick about!</i> <br>
    <strong>████: </strong> (sigh) We're not getting you another body. <br>
     <em>Cherripa: </em>It's stuffy in here. <br>
    Do you have any suggestions for how we can make this work? Balloons, maybe some wall paint-- <br>
    <em>Cherripa: </em>Oh my god, there you go again with the whole "we will do our best to make this place as comfortable for you uwu~" <br>
       <strong>████: </strong> We can't help you unless you're clear with your requests. <br>
       <em>Cherripa: </em>Give me your phone. <br>
        <strong>████: </strong> Why do you need my phone? <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>I've been watching you. <br>
        <strong>████: </strong> Okay, now you're just being creepy, do I need to call in security? <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>I promise I will not do anything creepy :3. You better put the three face in this transcript, I know you're recording. <br>
        <strong>████: </strong> Okay, okay, but don't do anything weird with my phone, it was expensive.  <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>You're a big fan of these things aren't you~? <br>
        <strong>████: </strong> Wh-What are you looking at!? You said you wouldn't do anything weird!!  <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>Relax. I'm talking about these things. <br>
          (The subject is seen presenting the phone to the handler.) <br>
        <strong>████: </strong> Why would you bring up that!? God, why did I agree to let you... my life is over... oh god... Why did I have to have ███████'s page open.... <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>Fufu~ I sense a great amount of substance coming from you, unfortunately it isn't mine to claim. What a shame... <br>
        (The handler is seen shaking in their seat with their face in their hands.) <br>
        <em>Cherripa: </em>Calm down. I'm practically handing you your fucking promotion right now.<br>
        <strong>████: </strong> What... do you mean by that?<br>
       <em>Cherripa: </em>I need you to help with me something...<br>
